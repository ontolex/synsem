# Data

Data snippets and sample data, either using OntoLex-SynSem or illustrating challenges or requirements.

The **original examples** for the 2016 vocabulary are in the [OntoLex GitHub repo](https://github.com/ontolex/ontolex/tree/master/Examples/synsem)

External sample data includes:
- Aldo Gangemi's historical FrameNet conversion, [OLiA mirror with provisional OLiA linking (pre 2012)](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia/tree/master/owl/experimental/semantics), apparently superseded by their more recent work on [FRED](https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/news/fred-and-tipalo-natural-language-rdfowl)
